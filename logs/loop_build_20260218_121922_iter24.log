Task 18.8 complete. Here's what was done:

**Task 18.8: Build athlete training view at `/athlete/train`**

1. **Modified `TrainingLog` component** (`src/components/training/TrainingLog.tsx`):
   - Added optional `mode` prop (`'coach' | 'athlete'`, defaults to `'coach'`)
   - Athlete selector dropdown is hidden when `mode === 'athlete'`
   - "No workout" message adapted for athlete context (doesn't say "This athlete has no workout...")

2. **Created `/athlete/train/page.tsx`**:
   - Client component using `useSession()` to get the athlete ID from NextAuth JWT
   - Loading state while session is being fetched
   - Error state if no athlete profile is linked
   - Renders `TrainingLog` with `mode="athlete"` and `initialAthleteId` from the session
   - Mobile-optimized layout matching the athlete shell

All validation passes (tsc, build). Committed as `c51366d`.
