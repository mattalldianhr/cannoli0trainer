**Task 17.1 complete.** Here's what was done:

**ProgramAssignment** — added 2 fields:
- `trainingDays` (Json, default `[1,2,4,5]`) — Mon/Tue/Thu/Fri training day config
- `isActive` (Boolean, default true) — soft-deactivation support

**WorkoutSession** — added 6 fields:
- `workoutId` (String?, FK -> Workout) — links session to source Workout
- `programAssignmentId` (String?, FK -> ProgramAssignment) — tracks generating assignment
- `isManuallyScheduled` (Boolean, default false) — coach manual override flag
- `isSkipped` (Boolean, default false) — coach skip flag
- `weekNumber` (Int?) — program week reference
- `dayNumber` (Int?) — program day reference

**Indexes** added on `workoutId` and `programAssignmentId`. **Reverse relations** added to Workout and ProgramAssignment models. Migration `20260218160513_add_scheduling_fields` applied. All validations pass (prisma validate, tsc, build).
