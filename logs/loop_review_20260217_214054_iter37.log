## Quick Spec Review — Iteration 37

**Findings: 0 new issues**

Task 5.4 (edit/delete athlete functionality) completed cleanly — no inconsistencies, mismatches, or unexpected values.

| Item | Count |
|------|-------|
| New findings | 0 |
| Specs updated | 0 |

**Carried forward (uncommitted spec updates from ~iter 10):**
1. **`specs/01-data-models-and-schema.md`** — Exercise model fields expanded, WorkoutSession & MaxSnapshot models added
2. **`specs/05-exercise-library.md`** — Categories updated to free-exercise-db taxonomy, seed count corrected from 30+ to 873

These are correct and match implemented code. Should be committed as a "spec sync" when ready.

**Continue building?** Yes — no blockers.
