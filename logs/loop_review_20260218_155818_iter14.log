## Quick Spec Review — Iteration 14 Summary

- **Findings: 1** (P2 — gender field gap)
- **Specs updated: None** (not blocking; noted in Discoveries)
- **Detail**: Spec 09 says DOTS/Wilks requires "bodyweight + total + gender" but the Athlete model has no `gender` field. Task 26.2 handled this with a UI toggle defaulting to male. Logged as a P2 discovery for a future schema migration.
- **Build status**: Clean — tsc and build passing, no errors
- **Continue building? Yes**
