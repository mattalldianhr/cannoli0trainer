## Quick Spec Review — Iteration 48 Summary

**Findings: 0 new issues.** Task 7.8 (program save create/update) completed cleanly with no spec mismatches or inconsistencies.

**Carried forward — 2 uncommitted spec updates** (flagged since iter 41, now **8 iterations**):

| Spec File | Change | Priority |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| `specs/01-data-models-and-schema.md` | Exercise model fields expanded, WorkoutSession & MaxSnapshot models added, WorkoutExercise fields added | P1 |
| `specs/05-exercise-library.md` | Categories updated to free-exercise-db taxonomy, seed count 873 | P1 |

**Specs updated this pass:** 0 (changes were already made in prior iterations, just never committed)

**Continue building?** Yes — no blockers. The two spec file updates are correct and well-documented with revision history. They should be committed at the next convenient opportunity to stop carrying this forward.
