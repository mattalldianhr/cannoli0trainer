**Task 1.6 complete.** Added three models to the Prisma schema:

- **BodyweightLog** — tracks athlete bodyweight over time (athleteId FK, weight, unit, loggedAt)
- **CompetitionMeet** — stores meet details (coachId FK, name, federation, date, location)
- **MeetEntry** — individual athlete entries per meet with 9 attempt fields (squat 1-3, bench 1-3, deadlift 1-3), openers JSON, warmupPlan JSON, notes

All reverse relations added to Coach and Athlete models. Cascade deletes configured on meet→entries and athlete→entries/bodyweightLogs. All validation passed (`prisma validate`, `prisma generate`, `tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`).
