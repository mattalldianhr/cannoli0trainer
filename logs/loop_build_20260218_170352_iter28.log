**Task 29.4 complete.** Changes made:

1. **`/api/train/route.ts`** — Fetches the coach's `defaultWeightUnit` from the database and includes it in all API response paths
2. **`TrainingLog.tsx`** — Extracts `defaultWeightUnit` from the API response (`data?.defaultWeightUnit ?? 'lbs'`) and:
   - Passes it to `ExerciseCard` as `weightUnit` prop
   - Uses it in `handleLogSet` (replaced hardcoded `'lbs'`)
   - Uses it in the weight input label (`Weight (kg)` or `Weight (lbs)`)
   - Uses it in session header volume display
   - Passes it to `WorkoutSummary` for the volume stat card

Per-set override still works since each `SetLog` stores its own `unit` field independently in the database — the coach preference only controls the default for new sets.
