**Task 1.7 complete.** Added 16 `@@index` directives across all 10 models with foreign keys:

| Model | Indexes Added |
|---|---|
| Athlete | `coachId` |
| Program | `coachId` |
| ProgramAssignment | `programId`, `athleteId`, `@@unique([programId, athleteId])` |
| Workout | `programId` |
| Exercise | `coachId` |
| WorkoutExercise | `workoutId`, `exerciseId` |
| SetLog | `workoutExerciseId`, `athleteId`, `[athleteId, completedAt]` (compound) |
| BodyweightLog | `athleteId` |
| CompetitionMeet | `coachId` |
| MeetEntry | `meetId`, `athleteId` |

Bonus: Added a compound unique constraint on `ProgramAssignment(programId, athleteId)` to prevent duplicate assignments, and a compound index on `SetLog(athleteId, completedAt)` for efficient training history queries.

All validations pass: `prisma validate`, `prisma generate`, `tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`.
