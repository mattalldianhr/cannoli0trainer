**Task 17.3 complete.**

Created `src/lib/scheduling/persist-schedule.ts` with the `persistSchedule()` function that:
- Takes `athleteId`, `programId`, `programAssignmentId`, and a `ScheduledSession[]` schedule
- Queries existing WorkoutSessions for the athlete on the scheduled dates
- Skips dates that already have sessions (idempotent)
- Creates all new sessions in a single Prisma `$transaction` for atomicity
- Links each session to the source Workout via `workoutId` and assignment via `programAssignmentId`
- Returns `{ created, skipped, total }` counts

8 unit tests pass covering: empty schedule, full creation, correct data shape, skip logic, full idempotent skip, correct query parameters, 16-session program, and assignment linking.

All validation passes: `tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build` (lint has pre-existing issue).
