**Task 26.1 complete.** Here's what was implemented:

**Schema**: Added `attemptResults Json?` field to `MeetEntry` model with migration.

**API**: Updated `PUT /api/meets/[id]/entries/[entryId]` to accept and persist `attemptResults`.

**UI (MeetDetail.tsx)**:
- **"Results" toggle button** per athlete card — activates results entry mode (auto-activates when saved results exist)
- **3-state make/miss toggle** per attempt: click cycles through good (green check) → miss (red X) → clear
- **Color-coded inputs**: green border/bg for good lifts, red for misses
- **Smart best attempt**: `bestAttempt()` now only counts successful (good) attempts when results data exists
- **Auto-calculated total**: sum of best successful attempt per lift
- **Pre-fill from results**: attempt weights populate from saved `attemptResults` when available, falling back to planned attempts
- **Results Summary table**: new "Attempts" column showing made/total (e.g. "7/9")
