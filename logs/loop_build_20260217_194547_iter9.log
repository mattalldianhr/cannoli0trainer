**Task 1.9 complete.** Here's what was added:

**New enums:**
- `WorkoutSessionStatus` — NOT_STARTED, PARTIALLY_COMPLETED, FULLY_COMPLETED
- `MaxSnapshotSource` — WORKOUT, MANUAL, IMPORT

**WorkoutSession model** — per-athlete per-date session metadata:
- Fields: athleteId, date, programId (optional), title, durationSeconds, completionPercentage, completedItems, totalItems, status
- Unique constraint on `[athleteId, date]` (one session per athlete per day)
- Indexes on athleteId, [athleteId, date], programId
- Relations to Athlete (cascade delete) and Program (set null on delete)

**MaxSnapshot model** — point-in-time exercise max records:
- Fields: athleteId, exerciseId, date, workingMax, generatedMax (optional), isCurrentMax, source
- Indexes on athleteId, exerciseId, [athleteId, exerciseId], [athleteId, date]
- Relations to Athlete (cascade delete) and Exercise

All validation passed: `prisma validate`, `prisma generate`, `tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`. Migration applied successfully.
