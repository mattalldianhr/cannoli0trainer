## Quick Spec Review Summary

- **Findings: 0**
- **Specs updated: None**
- **Continue building? Yes**

The most recent logs (iterations 10-11, tasks 24.3 and 25.1) are clean:
- No issues encountered, no inconsistencies, no mismatches
- Both tasks completed with `tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` passing
- Only known issue is a pre-existing `next lint` problem already documented
- The iter 11 review log is empty (0 bytes), meaning the review hadn't been written yet when the files were saved

The loop is healthy — no spec updates needed.
