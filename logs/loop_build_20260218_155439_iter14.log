**Task 26.2 complete.** Here's what was built:

### `src/lib/meets/results.ts` — Score calculation module
- `calculateMeetResult()` takes an athlete's meet entry data and computes:
  - Best successful attempt per lift (squat, bench, deadlift)
  - Total from best successful attempts
  - DOTS, Wilks, and Wilks 2020 scores using the `powerlifting-formulas` package
  - Made/attempted counts
- Handles missed lifts (only good attempts count toward total)
- Falls back to planned attempts when no make/miss data exists
- Returns `null` scores when bodyweight is missing

### `src/components/meets/MeetResultsSummary.tsx` — Results display component
- Results card with Trophy icon header
- Table showing: Athlete, Weight Class, BW, Squat, Bench, Deadlift, Total, Made count, DOTS, Wilks
- Green check / red X badges per attempt showing make/miss
- Sorted by total (highest first) with "1st" indicator
- Gender toggle (M/F) per athlete for score calculation — defaults to male since Athlete model has no gender field
- DOTS/Wilks columns only appear when bodyweight data is available
- Helpful message when scores can't be calculated due to missing bodyweight

### Integration
- Replaced the basic summary table in `MeetDetail.tsx` with the new `MeetResultsSummary` component
- All validation passes (tsc, build)
