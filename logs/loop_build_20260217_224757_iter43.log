**Task 7.3 complete.** Here's what was built:

**Server page** (`src/app/programs/new/page.tsx`):
- Fetches coach from Prisma, passes `coachId` to the builder component
- Follows the exact same pattern as `/exercises/new/page.tsx`

**Client component** (`src/components/programs/ProgramBuilder.tsx`):
- **Program metadata**: Name, description, type (Individual/Template/Group), periodization type (Block/DUP/Linear/RPE-Based/Hybrid)
- **Week management**: Add, remove, duplicate weeks with auto-renumbering
- **Day management**: Add, remove, duplicate days within weeks; editable day names and optional notes
- **Exercise support**: ExercisePicker integration — add exercises from the full library, remove exercises, compact row display with prescription type badges
- **Collapsible UI**: Weeks and days can be collapsed/expanded for overview
- **Summary stats**: Live badges showing total weeks, days, and exercises
- Uses all existing types from `lib/programs/types.ts` (ProgramFormState, WeekState, DayState, ExerciseEntry) and factory functions (createDefaultWeek, createDefaultDay, etc.)

All validation passed (`tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`). Committed as `ff6dc0e`.
