**Task 29.2 complete.** Here's what was built:

**Settings API** (`/api/settings`):
- `GET` returns coach profile, preferences, and notification settings
- `PUT` updates with validation (weight unit must be kg/lbs, rest timer 0-600s, name non-empty)

**Settings Page** (`/settings`):
- **Profile section**: name, email, brand name
- **Preferences section**: default weight unit (kg/lbs dropdown), timezone selector (15 common timezones), default rest timer (numeric input with 0-600s range)
- **Notifications section**: checkboxes for email on workout complete and check-in reminders
- Success/error feedback on save

**Navigation**: Gear icon added to both desktop and mobile nav, with active state highlighting.

All validation passes (tsc, build). Committed as `861e4f4`.
