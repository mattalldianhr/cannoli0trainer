**Task 14.4 complete.** Here's what was built:

**FlightTracker component** (`src/components/meets/FlightTracker.tsx`):
- Grid view where rows are warm-up sets (with times) and columns are athletes
- Shared flight start time and interval configuration
- Each cell shows the athlete's warm-up weight for that set as a clickable toggle (tap to mark complete)
- Live countdown timer showing time to next warm-up set across all athletes
- Time-based status highlighting (current set = green "NOW" badge, past sets dimmed)
- Progress summary bar showing completion count per athlete (e.g., "Matt 4/6")
- Appears automatically on meet detail page when 2+ athletes are entered

**WarmupCalculator refactor**: Exported `generateWarmupSchedule`, `formatTime`, `formatCountdown`, `getSetStatus`, and related types/constants so the FlightTracker can reuse the same warm-up generation logic.

**Integration**: FlightTracker is inserted on the meet detail page between the header and individual athlete cards, only when there are 2+ athletes.
