**Task 5.2 complete.** Created:

- **`src/components/athletes/AddAthleteForm.tsx`** — Client component with:
  - All profile fields: name (required), email, bodyweight, weight class, experience level (select), remote/competitor checkboxes, federation (shown conditionally when competitor checked), notes
  - Client-side validation (name required, submit disabled when empty)
  - API submission to `POST /api/athletes` with proper error handling
  - Loading state with spinner during submission
  - Redirects to `/athletes` on success
  - Back button and Cancel link navigation

- **`src/app/athletes/new/page.tsx`** — Server component that fetches the coach and passes `coachId` to the form

All checks pass: `tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`. Committed as `7eedd9b`.
