**Task 18.5 complete.** 

Created `src/middleware.ts` that:
- Uses NextAuth v5's `auth` wrapper to check session on every matching request
- Protects all `/athlete/*` routes except `/athlete/login` and `/athlete/check-email` (via the matcher regex)
- Redirects unauthenticated users to `/athlete/login` with a `callbackUrl` query param
- Leaves all coach routes completely unaffected

All checks pass: `tsc --noEmit` clean, `npm run build` succeeds (middleware detected as `ƒ Proxy`).
