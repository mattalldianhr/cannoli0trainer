**Task 21.4 complete.** Here's what was implemented:

**`src/lib/offline-queue.ts`** — Queue manager module:
- `enqueue()` / `dequeue()` / `getQueue()` / `clearQueue()` / `queueSize()` for localStorage-backed FIFO queue
- `syncQueue()` replays queued POSTs to `/api/sets`, handling success, 409 duplicates, 404 gone resources, and network errors
- 100 entry capacity limit

**`src/hooks/useOfflineSync.ts`** — Background sync hook:
- Listens for browser `online` event to sync immediately on reconnect
- Polls every 30s while items are queued
- Returns `pendingCount` for UI display and calls `onSync` callback after successful sync

**`src/components/training/TrainingLog.tsx`** — Integration:
- `handleLogSet` now catches network errors and enqueues the set payload instead of silently failing
- Yellow "N sets pending sync" banner appears when queued items exist, with an offline indicator when disconnected
- Queued items automatically sync and refresh the workout data when connectivity returns

All validation passes (tsc, build). Committed as `b25a89a`.
