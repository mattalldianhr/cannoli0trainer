**Task 18.9 complete.** Here's what was built:

**API endpoint** (`/api/athlete/calendar`):
- `GET /api/athlete/calendar?startDate=YYYY-MM-DD&endDate=YYYY-MM-DD`
- Auth-protected via `session.user.athleteId`
- Returns sessions with title, status, completion %, program name, week/day numbers
- Includes overall completion rate for the range

**Calendar page** (`/athlete/calendar`):
- **Week view** (default): 7 day cards (Mon-Sun) with workout indicators, status icons, completion badges, progress bars for in-progress workouts
- **Month view**: Compact grid with colored cells per status, status icons on workout days
- Week/month navigation with prev/next buttons and "Today" quick-return
- Week/Month toggle switch
- Status indicators: scheduled (circle), in progress (clock/amber), completed (check/green), skipped (ban)
- Actionable: tapping a NOT_STARTED or in-progress workout links to `/athlete/train`
- Mobile-optimized: 44px tap targets on day cells, responsive layout
- Suspense boundary for `useSearchParams()` compatibility

All validation passed: `tsc --noEmit` clean, `npm run build` successful.
