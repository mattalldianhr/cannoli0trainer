**Task 18.10 complete.** Here's what was built:

**API Route** (`/api/athlete/history`):
- `GET ?page=1&limit=20` — paginated list of completed/partially-completed WorkoutSessions with exercise summaries (names, volume, sets count)
- `GET ?sessionId=xxx` — detailed session view with full exercise breakdown and set logs (weight, reps, RPE, velocity)
- Auth-gated via NextAuth session with `athleteId`

**Page** (`/athlete/history/page.tsx`):
- Reverse-chronological session list with status icons, completion badges, program name, and volume stats
- Tap-to-expand reveals exercise details with per-set data (weight x reps @ RPE, velocity)
- Client-side detail caching (fetches once, cached for the session)
- "Load More" pagination (20 per page)
- Loading skeletons and empty state
- Mobile-optimized layout matching existing athlete page patterns
