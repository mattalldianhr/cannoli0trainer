## Quick Spec Review Summary

**Findings: 0 issues**

The most recent build log (iter5, Task 1.5 - SetLog model) completed cleanly:
- `prisma validate` passed
- `prisma generate` passed  
- `tsc --noEmit` passed
- `npm run build` passed

No occurrences of "issues encountered", "inconsistency", "doesn't match", "actually", or "missing" in any recent logs.

The previous review (iter4) also confirmed Tasks 1.1–1.4 all clean. Task 1.5 follows the same pattern.

**Known P3**: `next lint` broken on Next.js 16.1.6 — not blocking.

**Specs updated: None**  
**Continue building? Yes** — All Phase 1 tasks (1.1–1.5) completed cleanly. Ready for next phase.
