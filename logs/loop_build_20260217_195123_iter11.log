**Task 2.1 complete.** Here's the summary:

### What was done
- **Extended Exercise model** in Prisma schema: added `force`, `level`, `mechanic`, `equipment`, `primaryMuscles`, `secondaryMuscles`, `instructions`, `images` fields. Made `coachId` optional so library exercises (no coach owner) can coexist with coach-created exercises.
- **Added indexes** on `name` and `category` for search/filter performance.
- **Downloaded free-exercise-db** (873 exercises, public domain) to `prisma/seed-data/exercises.json`.
- **Created `prisma/seed.ts`** — idempotent seed script using `createMany`. Re-runs safely skip existing exercises.
- **Configured Prisma seed** in `package.json`.

### Validation
- `npx prisma validate` — passed
- `npx prisma db seed` — 873 exercises created
- Re-run seed — 0 created, 873 skipped (idempotent)
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — passed
- `npm run build` — passed

### Category breakdown
