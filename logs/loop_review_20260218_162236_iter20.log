The iter 20 build log is clean. Task 28.3 integrated notification DB record creation into both `notifyProgramAssignment` and `notifyWorkoutCompletion`, with a smart pattern: always persist the DB record, only send email when address is available. No inconsistencies, mismatches, missing items, or unexpected discoveries. Clean streak continues across all three Task 28 subtasks (28.1, 28.2, 28.3).
