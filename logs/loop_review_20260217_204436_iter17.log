## Quick Spec Review — Iteration 17

**Findings: 0 spec issues**

The iter17 build (Task 2.7 — fitness calculation libraries) completed cleanly:
- `@finegym/fitness-calc` v1.0.1 installed — all 7 1RM formulas working (Epley, Brzycki, Lombardi, Mayhew, O'Conner, Wathan, Lander)
- `powerlifting-formulas` v0.2.3 installed — DOTS, Wilks, Wilks 2020, Glossbrenner, Schwartz-Malone, Reshel all available
- `tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` both pass clean

No inconsistencies, missing items, or unexpected values discovered. The review log for iter17 was empty (likely wasn't populated yet when this session started).

| Item | Assessment | Priority |
|------|-----------|----------|
