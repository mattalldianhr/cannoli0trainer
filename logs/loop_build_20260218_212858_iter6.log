**Task 31.2 complete.** Here's what was implemented:

### Changes Made

**1. API Update** (`src/app/api/athletes/[id]/history/route.ts`):
- Session detail endpoint now returns `prescribed` data for each exercise (sets, reps, load, RPE, RIR, velocity target, percentage of 1RM, prescription type)
- Added `totalPrescribedVolume` and `totalActualVolume` to the session response for volume comparison

**2. UI Update** (`src/components/athletes/WorkoutHistoryList.tsx`):
- Each exercise in the expanded session detail now shows a **color-coded left border** indicating completion status:
  - **Green** — actual meets or exceeds prescribed (all sets done, all reps hit)
  - **Yellow/Amber** — partial completion (some sets logged but not all targets met)
  - **Red** — missed exercise (zero sets logged)
- Each exercise shows a **"Rx:" prescription line** displaying the prescribed sets×reps, load, RPE/RIR/velocity targets
- Below the prescription, the actual logged sets are shown with weight, reps, RPE, and velocity
- A **volume comparison summary card** at the bottom shows prescribed vs actual total volume with a percentage indicator

### Validation
- TypeScript: passes
- Build: passes
- Committed as `3429fe5`
