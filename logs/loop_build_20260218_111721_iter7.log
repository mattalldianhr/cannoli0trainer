**Task 17.5 complete.** Here's a summary of what was implemented:

### Files created
- **`src/lib/scheduling/detect-conflicts.ts`** — Conflict detection service that queries existing WorkoutSessions for an athlete on proposed schedule dates. Excludes sessions from the same assignment (re-assignment is idempotent). Returns detailed conflict info including existing title, status, and program.

- **`src/lib/scheduling/__tests__/detect-conflicts.test.ts`** — 8 unit tests covering: empty schedule, no conflicts, single/multiple conflicts, same-assignment exclusion, null titles (imported sessions), and partial overlap on a 4-week program.

### Files modified
- **`src/app/api/programs/[id]/assign/route.ts`** — Now accepts a `force` boolean in the request body. When `startDate` is provided:
  - Generates the proposed schedule and runs conflict detection per athlete
  - If conflicts found and `force !== true`: returns **409 Conflict** with detailed conflict info (dates, existing vs new titles, existing status) per athlete
  - If no conflicts or `force === true`: proceeds with session persistence as before

### Validation
- TypeScript: pass
- Build: pass
- All 31 scheduling tests pass (8 new + 23 existing)
