**Task 18.18 complete.** Here's what was implemented:

**Files created:**
- `public/sw.js` — Service worker with cache-first for static assets, network-first for navigation (offline fallback), skip for API/auth routes, auto-cleanup of old caches
- `src/app/offline/page.tsx` — Offline fallback page with WifiOff icon, explanation message, and "Try Again" button
- `src/components/ServiceWorkerRegistration.tsx` — Client component that registers the service worker on mount

**Files modified:**
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — Added `ServiceWorkerRegistration` component to root layout
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — Marked task complete (158/185)

**Validation:** `tsc --noEmit` passes, `npm run build` passes (lint is a pre-existing known issue).

**Remaining: 27 tasks** — next actionable code task would be **Task 18.19** (cache athlete workout data for offline training) or **Task 31.1** (workout history list for coach athlete view).
