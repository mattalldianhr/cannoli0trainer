**Task 10.4 complete.** Added a `WorkoutSummary` component to `TrainingLog.tsx` that renders when `completionPercent === 100`. It shows:

- **2×2 stat grid**: exercises, sets, reps, and volume (with icons)
- **Top RPE** across all logged sets (shown when > 0)
- **Green-themed** styling matching the existing completed exercise card pattern

All validation passed (tsc, build). Next incomplete task is **Task 11.1**: Create dashboard page at `/dashboard` with overview stat cards.
