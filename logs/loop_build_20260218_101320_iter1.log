{"level":"warn","message":"[BashTool] Pre-flight check is taking longer than expected. Run with ANTHROPIC_LOG=debug to check for failed or slow API requests."}
**Task 14.2 complete.** Here's what was built:

**API Routes:**
- `POST /api/meets/[id]/entries` — Add an athlete to a meet (with duplicate check)
- `PUT /api/meets/[id]/entries/[entryId]` — Update attempt values (SBD x 3 attempts)
- `DELETE /api/meets/[id]/entries/[entryId]` — Remove an athlete from a meet

**Server Page** (`/meets/[id]/page.tsx`):
- Fetches meet with entries, all available athletes, and current SBD maxes from MaxSnapshot
- Groups maxes by athlete for estimated 1RM reference

**Client Component** (`MeetDetail.tsx`):
- Meet header with date, federation, location, athlete count
- Per-athlete cards with SBD attempt planning grid (opener, 2nd, 3rd attempts)
- Estimated 1RM column showing each athlete's current max per lift
- Percentage display under each attempt input (% of e1RM)
- Best attempt and total calculation
- Add athlete dialog with auto-fill weight class from profile
- Save attempts and remove athlete actions
- Results summary table sorted by total

All validation passed: `tsc --noEmit` clean, `npm run build` clean.
