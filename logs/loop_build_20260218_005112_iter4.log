**Task 11.4 complete.** Added the "Upcoming Meets" section to the dashboard page:

- **Data fetcher**: `getUpcomingMeets()` queries `CompetitionMeet` records in the next 30 days, includes athlete entry counts via `_count`, ordered by date ascending
- **UI section**: Shows meet name, date, location, federation, athlete count, and days-until countdown. Links to `/meets/[id]` for each meet. Empty state shows "No meets scheduled" with a CTA to `/meets`
- **Validation**: `tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` both pass cleanly
