**Task 7.6 complete.** 

Week and day duplication were already implemented in the `ProgramBuilder` component. I added the missing **exercise duplication**:

- **`duplicateExercise` callback** — clones an exercise within its day, generating a new UUID while preserving all prescription settings, notes, superset group, tempo, etc.
- **Copy button on `ExerciseRow`** — appears on hover between the settings gear and delete trash icon, consistent with the existing UI pattern used for day-level duplication
- **Props threaded** through `WeekCard` → `DayCard` → `ExerciseRow`

All validation passed (tsc, build). Committed as `dae1966`.
