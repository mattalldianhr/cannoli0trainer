Task 25.2 is complete. Here's what was implemented:

**Task 25.2: Cross-session velocity trend chart (week-over-week fatigue)**

**Changes:**

1. **`src/lib/vbt/types.ts`** — Added 3 new types: `WeightedVelocitySet`, `WeeklyVelocityPoint`, and `VelocityTrendResult`

2. **`src/lib/vbt/velocity-profile.ts`** — Added `calculateVelocityTrend()` function that:
   - Filters sets to the ~80% 1RM load bracket (75-85%)
   - Groups by ISO week (Monday start)
   - Computes mean velocity per week
   - Requires 3+ weeks of data
   - Calculates week-over-week change using rolling 2-week averages
   - Alerts when velocity declines >5% (overreaching indicator)

3. **`src/components/charts/VelocityTrendChart.tsx`** — New Recharts LineChart component with:
   - Weekly mean velocity line (blue normally, amber on alert)
   - Reference line at overall average
   - Custom tooltip showing week, velocity, and set count
   - Week-over-week % change indicator
   - Alert banner when >5% drop detected

4. **`src/components/analytics/AnalyticsDashboard.tsx`** — Integrated the trend chart into the VBT analytics section between the preparedness/fatigue row and velocity profile table, with contextual empty states

**Validation:** `tsc --noEmit` passes, `npm run build` passes, 221/221 tests pass.
