**Task 4.5 complete.** Created CRUD API routes for SetLog entries:

- **`/api/sets` (POST)** — Creates a set log with required fields (`workoutExerciseId`, `athleteId`, `setNumber`, `reps`, `weight`) and optional fields (`unit`, `rpe`, `rir`, `velocity`, `notes`). Validates that both the workout exercise and athlete exist.
- **`/api/sets` (GET)** — Returns set logs filtered by `athleteId` (required), with optional `exerciseId`, `workoutExerciseId`, `limit`, and `offset` params. Includes related exercise data. Ordered by `completedAt` desc, then `setNumber` asc.
- **`/api/sets/[id]` (GET/PUT/DELETE)** — Standard single-resource operations with 404 handling.

All validation passed: `tsc --noEmit` clean, `npm run build` successful. Committed as `de7f8c3`.
