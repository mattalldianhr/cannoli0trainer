**Task 17.12 complete.** Here's what was done:

**Changes to `src/components/programs/AssignAthletes.tsx`:**

1. **Start date picker** — Date input defaulting to next Monday, with a calendar icon
2. **Training day checkboxes** — 7 day-of-week toggle buttons (Mon–Sun) showing which days are training days
3. **Presets** — "4-Day" (Mon/Tue/Thu/Fri, default), "3-Day" (Mon/Wed/Fri), "5-Day" (Mon–Fri) quick-select buttons, plus a "Custom" indicator when the selection doesn't match a preset
4. **Wired into API** — `startDate` and `trainingDays` are now sent in the POST body to `/api/programs/[id]/assign`, which already supports them for schedule generation
5. **Validation** — Assign button disabled when no training days selected, with a red validation message

All validation passes (tsc, build). The lint issue is pre-existing and unrelated.
