**Task 24.2 complete.** Here's what was built:

**API endpoint** (`/api/analytics/compare`):
- Accepts `athleteIds` (comma-separated, 2-3), `metric` (e1rm/volume/compliance), `from`/`to` date range, and optional `exerciseId` filter
- Fetches e1RM trends (from MaxSnapshot + RPE fallback), weekly volume tonnage, or weekly compliance per athlete
- Returns a union of exercises across athletes for the e1rm exercise filter

**AthleteComparisonView component**:
- Color-coded athlete selection chips (blue, green, amber) — max 3, min 2
- Three metric tabs: Est. 1RM, Volume, Compliance
- For e1rm: shows shared exercises with overlaid trend lines per athlete, plus exercise filter dropdown
- For volume: side-by-side bar chart of weekly tonnage per athlete
- For compliance: overlaid line chart of weekly compliance %
- Date range selector (4w/8w/12w/All Time)

**AnalyticsPageClient wrapper**:
- Individual/Compare toggle on the analytics page
- Supports `?view=compare` URL param for direct linking
