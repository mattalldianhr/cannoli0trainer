## Quick Spec Review — Iter 25 Summary

- **Findings**: 0 new issues
  - Task 28.8 correctly identified as already implemented (via `attemptResults` JSON field from Task 26.1) — no duplicate work
  - Task 29.1 (Coach settings fields) built cleanly: `defaultWeightUnit`, `timezone`, `defaultRestTimerSeconds` added with sensible defaults. Migration applied successfully.
- **Specs updated**: None needed
- **Carry-forward P2** (from iter 23): "Archived Programs" filter/tab on `/programs` page still not addressed — not blocking
- **Progress**: 144/179 tasks complete, 35 remaining
- **Continue building?** Yes
