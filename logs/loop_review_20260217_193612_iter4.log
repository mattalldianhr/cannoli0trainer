## Quick Spec Review Summary

**Findings: 0 issues**

Reviewed all 9 log files across 4 iterations (Tasks 1.1–1.4):

| Iteration | Task | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (Task 1.1) | 5 Prisma enums | Clean, matches spec |
| 2 (Task 1.2) | Coach model | Clean, matches spec |
| 3 (Task 1.3) | Athlete model | Clean, all validations pass |
| 4 (Task 1.4) | Program, ProgramAssignment, Workout, Exercise, WorkoutExercise models | Clean, all validations pass |

No occurrences of: "issues encountered", "inconsistency", "doesn't match", "actually" (discovery), or "missing".

**Known P3 item** (already tracked in Discoveries): `next lint` broken on Next.js 16.1.6 — does not block schema work.

**Specs updated: None**

**Continue building? Yes** — All 4 tasks in Phase 1 completed cleanly with `prisma validate`, `tsc --noEmit`, and `npm run build` all passing. Ready for the next phase.
