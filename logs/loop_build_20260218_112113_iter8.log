**Task 17.6 complete.** Here's what was built:

**Cleanup service** (`src/lib/scheduling/cleanup-assignment.ts`):
- `cleanupAssignmentSessions()` — standalone function to delete future NOT_STARTED sessions for an assignment
- `deactivateAssignment()` — sets `isActive=false` + cleans up sessions in a transaction
- `deleteAssignment()` — deletes the assignment record + cleans up sessions in a transaction
- All three preserve PARTIALLY_COMPLETED and FULLY_COMPLETED sessions

**DELETE API endpoint** (`/api/programs/[id]/assign`):
- Accepts `{ athleteId, mode?: 'deactivate' | 'delete' }`
- Default mode is `deactivate` (soft-delete)
- Returns cleanup counts (deleted/preserved)

**Tests**: 11 unit tests covering all three functions and edge cases.

**Validation**: tsc, build, and all 42 scheduling tests pass.
