## Planning Review Complete

Here's the summary of what I found and changed:

### What Changed in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

1. **Marked Task 13.6 as complete** `[x]` — the TeamBuildr export script is fully implemented at `scripts/teambuildr-export.ts` with supporting libraries (`rate-limiter`, `retry`, `checkpoint`, `logger`, `teambuildr-client`)

2. **Updated status**: 1/66 completed (was 0/66)

3. **Added note to Task 9.5** about the current Header nav containing research hub links that will need replacing

4. **Added comprehensive Discoveries section** documenting:
   - The codebase baseline (research/interview platform, not coaching yet)
   - Reusable assets (UI library, layout, Prisma infrastructure)
   - All confirmed gaps (every coaching feature is net-new)
   - Header branding issue ("S&C Research Hub" needs renaming)
   - Authentication gap (Spec 10 needs auth, but no auth tasks in plan — deferred)
   - Confirmation that no spec contradictions exist

### Key Findings

- **65 of 66 tasks are unstarted** — the entire coaching platform is greenfield
- **No tasks need reordering** — the dependency chain is sound (schema → API → UI → advanced features)
- **No new tasks needed yet** — authentication will be needed before the athlete portal goes live but doesn't block the coach-facing build (Priorities 1-9)
- **The existing UI component library, Prisma config, and layout components provide a solid foundation** to build on
