**Task 5.1 complete.** Here's what was built:

**`src/app/athletes/page.tsx`** — Server component that:
- Fetches all athletes from Prisma with counts (sessions, sets, program assignments)
- Includes last workout date and current program name via nested queries
- Serializes data and passes to client component
- Uses `force-dynamic` for fresh data on every request

**`src/components/athletes/AthleteList.tsx`** — Client component with:
- Search input (filters by name and email in real-time)
- Filter chips: All, Competitors, Remote, Needs Attention (3+ days since last workout)
- Each athlete rendered as a clickable Card linking to `/athletes/[id]`
- Shows badges (Competitor, Remote, Needs Attention), current program, bodyweight, experience level
- Quick stats: session count, set count, last workout relative date
- Empty state handling
- "Add Athlete" button linking to `/athletes/new`

All validation passed: `tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build` (page renders as dynamic `ƒ`).
