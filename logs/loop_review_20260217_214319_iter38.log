## Quick Spec Review — Iteration 38

**Findings: 0 new issues**

Task 6.1 (exercise library page) completed cleanly — `tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` both passed, no inconsistencies found.

| Item | Count |
|------|-------|
| New findings | 0 |
| Specs updated | 0 |

**Carried forward** (uncommitted from ~iter 10, still valid):
1. `specs/01-data-models-and-schema.md` — Exercise model fields expanded, WorkoutSession & MaxSnapshot models added
2. `specs/05-exercise-library.md` — Categories updated to free-exercise-db taxonomy, seed count corrected from 30+ to 873

These remain correct per implemented code. Consider committing as a spec sync.

**Continue building?** Yes — no blockers.
