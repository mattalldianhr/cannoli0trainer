Done. Here's what was accomplished:

**Task 20.1** (tag filter UI) — Already implemented in `ExerciseList.tsx`. Multi-select chip buttons for 4 powerlifting tags with AND logic against category filter. Marked complete.

**Task 20.2** (edit exercise form) — Implemented:
- **Shared `ExerciseForm` component** (`src/components/exercises/ExerciseForm.tsx`) — supports both create and edit modes via optional `exercise` prop. Pre-populates all fields when editing, uses PUT to `/api/exercises/[id]` for updates.
- **Edit page** at `/exercises/[id]/edit/page.tsx` — server component that fetches the exercise and passes it to `ExerciseForm`.
- **Edit button** — pencil icon added to each exercise card in `ExerciseList.tsx` linking to the edit page.
- **`AddExerciseForm`** simplified to a thin wrapper around the shared `ExerciseForm`.

All validations pass (tsc, build). Committed as `2a7635b`.
