**Task 28.7 complete.** Here's a summary of what was done:

### Changes
1. **Prisma schema**: Added `isActive Boolean @default(true)` to the Athlete model, with migration `20260218214854_add_athlete_is_active`

2. **API routes**:
   - `DELETE /api/athletes/[id]` — now archives by default (sets `isActive: false`), hard delete only via `?permanent=true` when athlete has zero data (mirrors the Program archive pattern)
   - `GET /api/athletes` — filters active only by default, `?isActive=false` for archived, `?isActive=all` for all
   - `PUT /api/athletes/[id]` — supports `isActive` field for reactivation

3. **UI**:
   - Athlete list now has an "Archived" filter tab (hidden when no archived athletes exist) with count badge and "Reactivate" buttons
   - Athlete profile "Delete" button replaced with "Archive" button
   - `DeleteAthleteDialog` renamed to `ArchiveAthleteDialog` with friendlier messaging about data preservation

4. **Query audit**: Added `isActive: true` to all 11 athlete listing queries across dashboard, analytics, schedule, train, meets, program assignment, and schedule API
