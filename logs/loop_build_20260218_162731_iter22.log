**Task 28.5 complete.** Here's what was done:

**Created:** `src/lib/coach.ts` — exports `getCurrentCoachId()` which returns the first coach's ID from the database (placeholder until auth is added).

**Updated 30 files** across pages and API routes:
- **Server pages** (7): dashboard, athletes, programs, exercises, meets, schedule, analytics — all list queries now filter by `coachId`
- **Detail pages** (4): athletes/[id], programs/[id], programs/[id]/edit, meets/[id] — ownership verified via `where: { id, coachId }`
- **New/edit pages** (4): athletes/new, exercises/new, programs/new, exercises/[id]/edit — replaced `prisma.coach.findFirst()` with `getCurrentCoachId()`
- **API list routes** (5): athletes, programs, exercises, meets, schedule — always scoped to coach
- **API detail routes** (6): athletes/[id], programs/[id], meets/[id], programs/[id]/template, programs/[id]/assign, analytics/[athleteId] — ownership checks on all GET/PUT/DELETE
- **API analytics** (2): compare and export routes — verify athletes belong to coach

**Validation:** tsc clean, build clean. Committed as `8dcb18f`.
