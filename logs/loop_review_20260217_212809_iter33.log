| Item | Count |
|------|-------|
| New findings | 0 |
| Specs updated | 0 |

**Carried forward** (uncommitted spec updates from earlier iterations):
- `specs/01-data-models-and-schema.md` — Exercise model fields expanded, WorkoutSession/MaxSnapshot models added, WorkoutExercise superset fields
- `specs/05-exercise-library.md` — Categories updated to free-exercise-db taxonomy, seed count corrected to 873

These have been carried across several iterations. Consider committing them now.

**Continue building?** Yes — Tasks 4.1–4.9 (all CRUD API routes + analytics) are complete. Ready for the next task group.
