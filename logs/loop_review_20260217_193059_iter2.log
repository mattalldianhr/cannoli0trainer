## Quick Spec Review Summary

**Findings: 0 issues**

Both build iterations completed cleanly:
- **Iter 1 (Task 1.1)**: 5 Prisma enums added — all match spec exactly (`ExperienceLevel`, `PrescriptionType`, `WeightUnit`, `ProgramType`, `PeriodizationType` with correct values)
- **Iter 2 (Task 1.2)**: `Coach` model added — matches spec fields exactly (id UUID PK, name, email unique, brandName optional, timestamps)

No keywords found for: issues encountered, inconsistency, doesn't match, actually, missing.

**Specs updated: None**

**Continue building? Yes** — Tasks 1.1 and 1.2 are clean and match specs. Next task in sequence should be the remaining data models (Athlete, Program, etc.).
