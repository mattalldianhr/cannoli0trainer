  - Search by exercise name
  - Category filter chips (All, Strength, Powerlifting, Olympic, Strongman, Plyometrics, Stretching, Cardio)
  - Tag filter chips (Competition Lifts, Variations, Accessory, GPP) with multi-select
  - Exercise cards showing name, category, equipment, primary muscles, force, and level
  - Competition/Variation badges on tagged exercises
