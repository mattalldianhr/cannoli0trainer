**Task 30.7 complete.** 

Created `error.tsx` files for 9 page routes:
- **Coach routes**: `/dashboard`, `/athletes`, `/programs`, `/exercises`, `/analytics`, `/meets`, `/schedule`, `/settings`
- **Athlete route**: `/athlete` (covers all sub-routes via layout)

Each error boundary:
- Is a `'use client'` component (required by Next.js)
- Shows an `AlertTriangle` icon + "Something went wrong" message with context-specific description
- Provides a "Try again" button that calls the `reset()` prop to re-render the route
- Logs errors to console in development mode only

All validation passed (tsc, build). 155/179 tasks complete, 24 remaining.
