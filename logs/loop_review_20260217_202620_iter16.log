## Quick Spec Review — Iteration 16

**Findings: 0 spec issues**

The iter16 build (Task 2.6 — import validation script) completed cleanly with all 42 validation checks passing. The key discovery about TeamBuildr underreporting tonnage (16-47%) and reps (63-302%) is interesting data quality context but not a spec issue — our DB correctly stores the raw set data.

| Item | Assessment | Priority |
|------|-----------|----------|
| TB summary underreports tonnage/reps | Data quality note, our DB has correct raw data | P3 — informational |
| 42/42 validation checks passing | Confirms import pipeline is solid | N/A |

**Specs updated:** 0
**Continue building?** Yes — no blockers. Phase 2 (data import) appears complete.
