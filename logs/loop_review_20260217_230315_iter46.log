## Quick Spec Review — Iteration 46 Summary

**Findings: 0 new issues.** Task 7.6 (exercise duplication) completed cleanly with no spec conflicts.

**Carried forward — 2 uncommitted spec updates** (flagged since iter 41):

| Spec File | Change | Priority | Status |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------|
| `specs/01-data-models-and-schema.md` | Exercise model fields expanded (free-exercise-db taxonomy), WorkoutSession & MaxSnapshot models added, WorkoutExercise fields (superset, tempo, etc.) | P1 | Modified, uncommitted |
| `specs/05-exercise-library.md` | Categories updated to free-exercise-db taxonomy, seed count 30+ → 873 | P1 | Modified, uncommitted |

Both diffs look correct — they reflect real discoveries from Tasks 2.1 and 2.3 and have proper revision history entries. These have been carried forward for **6 iterations** now. They should be committed.

**Specs updated this pass:** 0 (no new issues found)  
**Continue building?** Yes — no blockers. Recommend committing the two spec updates at the next natural stopping point.
