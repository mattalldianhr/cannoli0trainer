## Quick Spec Review — Iteration 15 Summary

- **Findings: 0**
- **Specs updated: None**
- **Detail**: Task 27.1 (RPE history scatter+trend chart) completed cleanly. No inconsistencies, missing fields, or spec mismatches reported. Build and type-check pass. Implementation aligns with spec expectations (RPE data from SetLog, scatter + moving average trend, y-axis 6–10.5 range).
- **Prior outstanding**: P2 gender field gap from iter 14 remains noted — not blocking.
- **Continue building? Yes**
