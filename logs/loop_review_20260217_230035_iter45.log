## Quick Spec Review — Iteration 45 Summary

**Findings: 0 new issues.** Task 7.5 (prescription type conditional fields with RPE ranges) completed cleanly.

**Carried forward — 2 uncommitted spec updates** (flagged since iter 41):

| Spec File | Change | Priority |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| `specs/01-data-models-and-schema.md` | Exercise model fields expanded, WorkoutSession & MaxSnapshot models added | P1 |
| `specs/05-exercise-library.md` | Categories updated to free-exercise-db taxonomy, seed count 873 | P1 |

**Specs updated this pass:** 0  
**Continue building?** Yes — no blockers. The two spec diffs have been carried forward for several iterations now; would recommend committing them at the next natural stopping point.
