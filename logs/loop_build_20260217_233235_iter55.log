Task 10.1 is complete. Here's what was built:

**Task 10.1: Create training log page at `/train` showing today's workout**

**Files created:**
- `src/app/train/page.tsx` — Server page with athlete list fetched from DB, renders `TrainingLog` component inside a mobile-friendly `Container` (max-w-2xl)
- `src/app/api/train/route.ts` — API endpoint that takes `athleteId` + `date`, finds the `WorkoutSession`, loads all `WorkoutExercise` records with their prescriptions and existing `SetLog` data, plus fetches previous performance for each exercise
- `src/components/training/TrainingLog.tsx` — Client component with:
  - Athlete selector dropdown
  - Date navigation (prev/next day, date picker, "Today" button)
  - Session header card with title, program name, status badge, progress bar
  - Completion stats (exercises done, sets logged, total volume)
  - Exercise cards showing: name, prescription (sets×reps @ load), prescription type badge, superset grouping, tempo/rest info, notes, previous performance reference ("Last: 225 lbs × 5"), and completed set summaries with green checkmarks
  - Empty state when no workout is scheduled
  - Loading spinner during fetch

**Validation:** `tsc --noEmit` passes, `npm run build` passes (lint known broken pre-existing).
