**Task 5.4 complete.** Here's what was implemented:

1. **`src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`** — New Radix UI Dialog primitive component (used `@radix-ui/react-dialog` which was already installed)

2. **`src/components/athletes/EditAthleteForm.tsx`** — Edit form pre-populated with athlete data, calls `PUT /api/athletes/[id]`, refreshes page on save

3. **`src/components/athletes/DeleteAthleteDialog.tsx`** — Confirmation dialog with warning message, calls `DELETE /api/athletes/[id]`, redirects to `/athletes` on success

4. **`src/components/athletes/AthleteProfile.tsx`** — Added Edit and Delete buttons to the profile header. Edit toggles to an inline edit form view. Delete opens the confirmation dialog.

All validation passed: `tsc --noEmit` clean, `npm run build` successful (lint skipped — pre-existing Next.js 16 issue).
