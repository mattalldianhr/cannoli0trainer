Done. Here's what happened this iteration:

**Tasks 12.3 & 12.4** — Already fully implemented in the existing `AnalyticsDashboard.tsx` (from Task 12.2). Marked complete with notes.

**Task 12.5** — Implemented CSV export:
- Created `/api/analytics/[athleteId]/export/route.ts` — streams CSV with Date, Exercise, Set, Reps, Weight, Unit, RPE, RIR, Velocity, Notes columns. Respects date range params, proper CSV escaping, and `Content-Disposition` download header.
- Added "CSV" download button to the analytics dashboard next to the date range controls, which triggers the export with the currently selected date range.

Build passes. Committed as `c8e09da`.
