**Task 3.6 complete.** Here's what was done:

- **Installed** `@playwright/test` as a dev dependency + Chromium browser
- **Created** `playwright.config.ts` — configured for `e2e/` test directory, Chromium project, auto-starts dev server (or uses `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` for production testing)
- **Created** `e2e/smoke.spec.ts` — 5 smoke tests:
  1. Homepage loads with correct title
  2. `/athletes` lists 5 athletes (Matt, Chris, Michael, Hannah, Maddy)
  3. `/exercises` shows exercise library with working search
  4. `/dashboard` displays stat cards with non-zero values
  5. `/analytics` renders charts
- **Added** `test:e2e` npm script and updated AGENTS.md
- **Excluded** `e2e/` from Vitest so the two test runners don't conflict
- **All validation passes**: `tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, `npm run test` (163 unit tests)

Note: The smoke tests for `/athletes`, `/exercises`, `/dashboard`, and `/analytics` will fail until those pages are built in Priorities 4-12. The test scaffolding is ready to validate them once implemented.
