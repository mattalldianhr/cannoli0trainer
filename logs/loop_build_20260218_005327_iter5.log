**Task 11.5 complete.** Here's what was done:

- **Header nav**: Replaced 6 research hub links (Home, Research, Interview, Submissions, Findings, PRD) with 4 coaching platform links (Dashboard, Athletes, Programs, Exercises)
- **Branding**: Changed "S&C Research Hub" to "Cannoli Trainer"  
- **Logo link**: Updated to point to `/dashboard` instead of `/`
- **Homepage redirect**: `/` now redirects to `/dashboard`
- **Active state**: Cleaned up the active link detection (removed unnecessary `/` guard)
- **Validation**: `tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` both pass (lint has pre-existing Next.js 16 issue)

Next incomplete task: **Task 12.1** — Install recharts and create base chart components.
