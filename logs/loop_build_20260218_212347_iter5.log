**Task 31.1 complete.** Here's what was built:

**API Route** — `src/app/api/athletes/[id]/history/route.ts`
- Coach-scoped endpoint (verifies athlete belongs to coach)
- Paginated list: `GET /api/athletes/[id]/history?page=1&limit=20`
- Session detail: `GET /api/athletes/[id]/history?sessionId=...`
- Returns date, title, status, completion %, volume (calculated from SetLogs), sets count, duration, exercise count

**Component** — `src/components/athletes/WorkoutHistoryList.tsx`
- Client component that fetches paginated workout sessions (20 per page)
- Each session row shows: status icon, title/date, program name, completion badge, exercise count, sets, volume, duration
- Click-to-expand loads session detail with per-exercise breakdown (sets with weight/reps/RPE/velocity)
- Detail results cached to avoid refetching
- "Load More" pagination button
- Loading skeleton and empty state

**Integration** — Replaced the simple "Recent Sessions" list in `AthleteProfile.tsx` Training tab with the new `WorkoutHistoryList` component. Current Maxes section preserved above it.
