**Task 18.12 complete.**

**What was done**: Integrated the existing `notifyWorkoutCompletion()` function into `src/lib/training/update-session-status.ts`. The email fires only on the **transition** to `FULLY_COMPLETED` — it captures the session's previous status before updating, then compares to the new status. When the transition is detected, it looks up the athlete's coach email and calls `notifyWorkoutCompletion` fire-and-forget (with `.catch()` to avoid unhandled rejections). The email includes athlete name, workout name, completion %, date, and a link to the athlete's profile.

**Validation**: `tsc --noEmit` passed, `npm run build` passed. Lint has the pre-existing Next.js 16 issue (not related to this change).
