## Quick Spec Review — Iteration 12

**Findings: 0 issues**

Task 2.2 build log is clean:
- Tagged 165 exercises with powerlifting categories, created 66 new powerlifting-specific exercises
- Total exercise count grew from 873 to 939
- `tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` both pass
- No error keywords found

The iter 11 review already caught and fixed the two P2 spec drifts (Exercise model expansion, category taxonomy). Both specs have proper revision histories.

**Specs updated: None needed**
**Continue building? Yes** — Task 2.2 is complete, ready for the next task.
