Build log (iter 28, Task 4.4) completed cleanly:

- TypeScript clean, build successful
- Committed as `cdbfc73`
- No inconsistencies, mismatches, or unexpected values

| Item | Count |
|------|-------|
| New findings | 0 |
| Specs updated | 0 |
| Prior uncommitted spec changes | 2 files — valid corrections from earlier iterations |

**Uncommitted spec changes** (from earlier iterations, still valid):
- `specs/01-data-models-and-schema.md` — Exercise model fields expanded, WorkoutSession/MaxSnapshot models added, WorkoutExercise superset fields added
- `specs/05-exercise-library.md` — Categories updated to free-exercise-db taxonomy, seed count corrected to 873

These are all accurate corrections discovered during earlier tasks. They should be committed when convenient.

**Continue building?** Yes — Task 4.4 done cleanly. Ready for next task.
