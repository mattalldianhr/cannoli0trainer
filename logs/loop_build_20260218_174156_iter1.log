**Task 30.4 complete.** Added success/error toasts to 13 mutation components across the app:

- **Athletes**: AthleteList (reactivate), DeleteAthleteDialog (archive), BulkAssignDialog (bulk assign)
- **Exercises**: ExerciseForm (create/update), DeleteExerciseDialog (delete with 409 conflict handling)
- **Programs**: ArchiveProgram, SaveAsTemplate, TemplateList (archive), AssignAthletes
- **Schedule**: WeeklyCalendar (replaced `alert()` calls with toasts for move/skip)
- **Meets**: CreateMeetDialog, MeetDetail (add athlete, save attempts, remove athlete)
- **Settings**: SettingsForm (save)

Excluded per spec: TrainingLog set logging (too frequent), ProgramBuilder auto-save (too frequent).

Build passes cleanly. Committed as `66f6a0b`.
