## Quick Spec Review — Iteration 34

**Findings: 0 new issues**

Build log (iter 34, Task 5.1) completed cleanly:
- Athletes listing page created at `/athletes` with search/filter
- TypeScript clean, build successful
- No inconsistencies, mismatches, or unexpected values found

| Item | Count |
|------|-------|
| New findings | 0 |
| Specs updated | 0 |

**Carried forward** (uncommitted spec updates from earlier iterations — still need committing):
- `specs/01-data-models-and-schema.md` — Exercise model fields expanded, WorkoutSession/MaxSnapshot models added, WorkoutExercise superset fields
- `specs/05-exercise-library.md` — Categories updated to free-exercise-db taxonomy, seed count corrected to 873

These changes have been carried forward since ~iteration 10. They're accurate and reflect what was actually built. Would recommend committing them as a standalone "spec sync" commit.

**Continue building?** Yes — Task 5.1 complete, ready for the next task.
