## Quick Spec Review — Iter 4 Summary

- **Findings**: 0 issues
  - Task 30.7 (React error boundaries) completed cleanly — 9 route-level `error.tsx` files created
  - Task 30.6 (ConfirmDialog) also clean from prior iteration
  - Build and type-check both pass
  - No inconsistencies, missing items, or unexpected discoveries in either log
- **Specs updated**: None needed
- **Carry-forward P2**: "Archived Programs" filter/tab on `/programs` page (from iter 23) — not blocking
- **Continue building?** Yes
