## Quick Spec Review Summary

- **Findings: 0 blocking issues**
- **Specs updated: None needed**
- **Continue building? Yes**

**Details:**
- **Iter 13 (Task 26.1)**: Build log describes `attemptResults` JSON field on MeetEntry, 3-state make/miss toggle, best successful attempt calculation, auto-calculated total, and pre-fill from planned attempts. This aligns perfectly with the spec in `specs/09-competition-prep.md` lines 44-59 (schema shape, `good` boolean, pre-fill behavior, best attempt logic, total calculation).
- **Iter 12 (Task 25.2)**: Velocity trend chart with >5% decline alert — clean, no spec issues.
- **Iter 11 (Task 25.1)**: Velocity loss indicator using >20% threshold — clean.
- **Iter 10 (Task 24.3)**: Embedded analytics on athlete profile — clean.
- **Iter 12 review** already confirmed iterations 10-12 were clean. Iter 13 review log was empty (0 bytes, review hadn't run yet).
- All iterations report `tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` passing, 221/221 tests passing.
- Only known issue: pre-existing `next lint` problem (already documented in Discoveries).

The loop is healthy. Next up is **Task 26.2** (meet results summary with DOTS/Wilks scores).
