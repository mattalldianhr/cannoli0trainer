Task 30.2 complete. Here's what was done:

**Updated 6 components to use the shared `EmptyState` component:**

1. **AthleteList** - Added contextual empty states: archived (Archive icon), search miss (Search icon), and no athletes (Users icon + "Add Your First Athlete" CTA)
2. **ProgramList** - Added search miss (Search icon) and no programs (ClipboardList icon + "Create Your First Program" CTA)
3. **ExerciseList** - Added filter miss (Search icon) and no exercises (Dumbbell icon + "Add Exercise" CTA)
4. **MeetList** - Added search miss (Search icon), no meets (Trophy icon + "Schedule Your First Meet" CTA), and filter miss (Calendar icon)
5. **WeeklyCalendar** - Added no athletes state (Users icon + "Add Athlete" CTA or filter suggestion)
6. **TrainPage** (server) - Added no athletes state (Dumbbell icon + "Add Athlete" CTA) before rendering TrainingLog

Dashboard, Analytics, and TrainingLog already had well-implemented empty states and were left as-is.
