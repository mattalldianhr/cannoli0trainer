| Item | Count |
|------|-------|
| New findings | 0 |
| Specs updated | 0 |

**Carried forward** (from earlier iterations, still uncommitted):
- `specs/01-data-models-and-schema.md` — Exercise model fields expanded, WorkoutSession/MaxSnapshot models added, WorkoutExercise superset fields added (+47 lines)
- `specs/05-exercise-library.md` — Categories updated to free-exercise-db taxonomy, seed count corrected to 873 (+5 lines)

These are valid discoveries from prior tasks and should be committed when convenient.

**Continue building?** Yes — Tasks 4.1–4.7 (all CRUD API routes) are complete. Ready for the next task group.
