**Task 30.3 complete.** Here's what was done:

- Installed `sonner` npm package
- Added `<Toaster position="bottom-right" />` to the root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`), placed outside `ConditionalCoachChrome` so toasts render on both coach and athlete routes
- Created `src/lib/toast.ts` exporting `showSuccess`, `showError`, and `showLoading` wrapper functions
- Sonner automatically uses bottom-center positioning on mobile viewports
- All validation passes (tsc, build)
- Committed as `abf38bf`
