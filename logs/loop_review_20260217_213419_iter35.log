## Quick Spec Review — Iteration 35

**Findings: 0 new issues**

Build log (iter 35, Task 5.2) completed cleanly:
- "Add Athlete" form created at `/athletes/new` with validation
- TypeScript clean, build successful
- No inconsistencies, mismatches, or unexpected values found

| Item | Count |
|------|-------|
| New findings | 0 |
| Specs updated | 0 |

**Carried forward** (uncommitted spec updates from earlier iterations — still need committing):
- `specs/01-data-models-and-schema.md` — Exercise model fields expanded, WorkoutSession/MaxSnapshot models added, WorkoutExercise superset fields
- `specs/05-exercise-library.md` — Categories updated to free-exercise-db taxonomy, seed count corrected to 873

These have been carried forward since ~iteration 10. The previous review (iter 34) recommended committing them as a standalone "spec sync" commit.

**Continue building?** Yes — Task 5.2 complete, ready for the next task.
