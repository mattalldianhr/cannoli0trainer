**Task 7.7 complete.** Here's what was implemented:

- **`moveExercise` callback** in `ProgramBuilder` — swaps two adjacent exercises and renumbers all `order` values
- **Move up/down buttons** in `ExerciseRow` — stacked arrow buttons replace the static grip icon, with `isFirst`/`isLast` props to disable at boundaries
- **Props threaded** through `WeekCard` → `DayCard` → `ExerciseRow` via `onMoveExercise`

All validation passed (tsc, build). Committed as `af29676`.
