Task 19.3 complete. Two changes made:

1. **`src/components/athletes/AthleteProfile.tsx`** — Added a "View Full Analytics" button at the top of the Analytics tab that links to `/analytics?athleteId=[id]`
2. **`src/app/analytics/page.tsx`** — Updated the analytics page to read `athleteId` from search params and pass it as `initialAthleteId` to `AnalyticsDashboard`, so the athlete is pre-selected when navigating from the profile
