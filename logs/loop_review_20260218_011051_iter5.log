The review log for iter 5 is empty (likely the review process was interrupted). Let me analyze the build log for iter 5 instead.

## Quick Spec Review Summary — Iter 5

**Findings: 0**

- Build log (Task 11.5 — Header nav update): Clean completion
- Nav updated from research hub links to coaching platform links (Dashboard, Athletes, Programs, Exercises)
- Branding changed to "Cannoli Trainer", logo links to `/dashboard`
- `tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` both pass
- Pre-existing Next.js 16 lint issue noted (not new)
- No inconsistencies, mismatches, or unexpected values detected

**Specs updated:** None needed

**Continue building?** Yes — all 5 iterations in this session (Tasks 11.1–11.5) completed cleanly. Next up is Task 12.1 (install recharts and create base chart components).
