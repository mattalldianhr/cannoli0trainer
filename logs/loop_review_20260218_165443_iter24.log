The P2 from iter 23 (missing "Archived Programs" filter on `/programs` page) was not addressed in iter 24 — iter 24 focused on Athlete archiving. That's a separate concern.

## Quick Spec Review — Iter 24 Summary

- **Findings**: 0 new issues
  - Task 28.7 (Athlete `isActive` soft-delete) built cleanly and aligns with spec `03-athlete-management.md` which specifies "filter by status (active/inactive)"
  - Implementation matches acceptance criteria: `isActive Boolean @default(true)`, active-only default filter, Archived tab, reactivation support, hard delete only with zero data
- **Specs updated**: None needed
- **Carry-forward P2** (from iter 23): "Archived Programs" filter/tab on `/programs` page still missing — not blocking
- **Continue building?** Yes
