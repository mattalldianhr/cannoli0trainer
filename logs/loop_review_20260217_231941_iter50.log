## Quick Spec Review — Iteration 50 Summary

**Findings: 0 new issues.** Task 8.1 (Save as Template) completed cleanly — no spec mismatches detected.

**Carried forward — 2 uncommitted spec updates** (now **10 iterations** since first flagged in iter 41):

| Spec File | Change | Priority |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| `specs/01-data-models-and-schema.md` | Exercise model fields expanded, WorkoutSession & MaxSnapshot models added, WorkoutExercise fields | P1 |
| `specs/05-exercise-library.md` | Categories updated to free-exercise-db taxonomy, seed count 873 | P1 |

Both diffs look correct — they reflect real implementation discoveries (free-exercise-db taxonomy, additional model fields). No spec inaccuracies found.

**Specs updated this pass:** 0 — no new issues found.

**Recommendation:** These spec changes have been pending for 10 iterations. They should be committed at the next opportunity. Would you like me to commit them now?

**Continue building?** Yes — no blockers.
