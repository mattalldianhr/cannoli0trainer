**Task 19.1 complete.** Here's what was implemented:

**AthleteList changes:**
- Added checkboxes on every athlete row (checkbox click doesn't navigate, card content still links to profile)
- "Select all / Deselect all" toggle above the list
- Bulk action bar appears when any athletes are selected, showing count + "Assign Program" button + clear selection
- Selected cards get a primary ring highlight

**New BulkAssignDialog component:**
- Program picker with search filtering
- Start date picker (defaults to next Monday)
- Training day presets (3-Day, 4-Day, 5-Day) and custom day toggles
- Calls the existing `/api/programs/[id]/assign` endpoint with `athleteIds` array
- Clears selection on success and refreshes the page

All validation passed (tsc, build). Committed as `eeb7543`.
