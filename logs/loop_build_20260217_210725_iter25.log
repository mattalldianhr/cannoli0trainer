**Task 4.1 complete.** Created two API route files:

- **`/api/coaches` (route.ts)**: POST creates a coach with name/email validation and unique email check (409 on conflict). GET returns all coaches with athlete/program counts.
- **`/api/coaches/[id]` (route.ts)**: GET returns a single coach with relation counts (athletes, programs, exercises, meets). PUT updates coach fields with partial update support and email uniqueness check.

All validation passed: `tsc --noEmit` clean, `npm run build` successful. Committed as `877981f`.
