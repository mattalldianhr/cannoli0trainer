**Task 7.9 complete.** Here's what was done:

- **New file**: `src/components/programs/AssignAthletes.tsx` — Client component with a dialog that:
  - Fetches all athletes from `/api/athletes` when opened
  - Shows checkboxes for each athlete, with already-assigned athletes disabled and marked with a checkmark
  - POSTs new selections to `/api/programs/[id]/assign` (the existing API route)
  - Refreshes the page on success to show updated assignments
  - Only appears for non-template programs

- **Modified**: `src/app/programs/[id]/page.tsx` — Added the "Assign to Athletes" button in the header bar next to the Edit button

- **Validation**: `tsc --noEmit` clean, `npm run build` passes
