**Task 18.6 complete.** Here's what was implemented:

1. **`src/app/athlete/layout.tsx`** — Athlete shell layout that:
   - Wraps authenticated routes with `SessionProvider` from next-auth
   - Shows a minimal top header bar with "Cannoli Trainer" branding
   - Renders `AthleteBottomNav` at the bottom
   - Skips the chrome for public routes (login, check-email) so they keep their standalone layouts

2. **`src/components/athlete/AthleteBottomNav.tsx`** — Fixed bottom navigation with:
   - 4 tabs: Dashboard, Train, Calendar, History (using lucide-react icons)
   - 56px min-height tap targets (exceeds 44px requirement)
   - Active state highlighting via pathname matching
   - Safe area padding for devices with home indicators
   - Backdrop blur matching the coach header style

3. **`src/components/layout/ConditionalCoachChrome.tsx`** — Updated root layout to conditionally hide the coach Header/Footer on `/athlete/*` routes, preventing double chrome.

4. **`src/app/layout.tsx`** — Updated to use `ConditionalCoachChrome` and renamed metadata to "Cannoli Trainer".
