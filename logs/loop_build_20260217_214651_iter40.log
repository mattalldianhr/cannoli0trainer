**Task 6.3 complete.** Created `src/components/programs/ExercisePicker.tsx` — a reusable dialog modal that:

- Fetches exercises from `/api/exercises` on first open (lazy loading)
- Provides search-by-name filtering
- Has category filters (strength, powerlifting, olympic, etc.) matching ExerciseList
- Has tag filters (competition lifts, variations, accessory, GPP)
- Shows exercise details (name, category, equipment, muscles, badges)
- Calls `onSelect(exercise)` with full exercise data when clicked, then closes
- Resets filters on selection for clean reuse
- Controlled via `open`/`onOpenChange` props for easy integration into program builder

All validation passed: `tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`. Committed as `8b2888a`.
