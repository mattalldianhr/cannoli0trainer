**Carried forward** (uncommitted from earlier iterations):
- `specs/01-data-models-and-schema.md` — Exercise model fields expanded, WorkoutSession/MaxSnapshot models added, WorkoutExercise superset fields (+47 lines)
- `specs/05-exercise-library.md` — Categories updated to free-exercise-db taxonomy, seed count corrected to 873 (+5 lines)

These are valid discoveries from prior tasks. Consider committing them when convenient.

**Continue building?** Yes — Tasks 4.1–4.8 (all CRUD API routes + program assignment) are complete. Ready for the next task group.
