**Task 27.2 complete.** Here's the summary:

**What was found**: The RPE accuracy module (`src/lib/analytics/rpe-accuracy.ts`), API integration in the analytics route, and dashboard UI (accuracy metric card + weekly trend chart) were all already implemented in prior tasks. The missing piece was **unit tests**.

**What was done**:
- Created `src/lib/analytics/rpe-accuracy.test.ts` with **22 unit tests** covering:
  - `estimateRPEFromLoad` reverse lookup — 9 tests (exact matches, closest RPE between values, boundary conditions, rounding)
  - `calculateRpeAccuracy` — 13 tests (null handling, perfect accuracy, over/underrating, aggregate deviation, weekly trend generation, invalid input filtering, rounding)
- All validation passed: `tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`
- Committed as `0c2147f`

**Status**: 129/179 tasks complete, 50 remaining.
