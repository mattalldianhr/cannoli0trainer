**Task 18.19 complete.** Here's what was implemented:

**Service Worker (`public/sw.js`):**
- Upgraded to v2 with a dedicated `cannoli-api-v1` cache for API responses
- Added network-first caching with stale fallback for `/api/train`, `/api/athlete/dashboard`, `/api/athlete/calendar`, `/api/athlete/history`
- Static assets remain cache-first, auth routes remain uncached

**New: `useOnlineStatus` hook (`src/hooks/useOnlineStatus.ts`):**
- Tracks browser online/offline status via `navigator.onLine` + event listeners
- Returns boolean for clean conditional rendering

**New: `OfflineIndicator` component (`src/components/shared/OfflineIndicator.tsx`):**
- Amber pill badge with WifiOff icon, only renders when offline
- Added to athlete layout header for global visibility

**TrainingLog updates:**
- Shows "Offline — viewing cached workout data" banner when offline with stale data
- Shows "Offline — you can still log sets" when offline without cached data
- Auto-refetches when connectivity returns and clears stale flag
- Simplified pending sync badge (removed redundant inline offline indicator)
