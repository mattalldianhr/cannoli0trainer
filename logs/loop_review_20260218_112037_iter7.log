The spec says "conflict is flagged to the coach" but doesn't specify the mechanism. Task 17.5 implemented it as a **409 Conflict** response with a `force` boolean to override. This is a reasonable implementation that's consistent with the spec's intent — no spec update needed since the spec was intentionally non-prescriptive about the HTTP mechanism.

## Quick Spec Review Summary

Task 17.5 (conflict detection for overlapping program assignments) completed cleanly — all 31 scheduling tests pass, TypeScript clean, build succeeds. The 409/force mechanism for conflict resolution is consistent with the spec's requirement to "flag conflicts to the coach." No inconsistencies or mismatches found.
