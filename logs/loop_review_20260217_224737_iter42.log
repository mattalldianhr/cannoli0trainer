## Quick Spec Review — Iteration 42 Summary

**Findings: 0 new issues.** Task 7.2 (program builder types) completed cleanly — `tsc` and `npm run build` both passed.

**Carried forward — 2 uncommitted spec updates** from earlier iterations:

| Spec File | Change | Priority |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| `specs/01-data-models-and-schema.md` | Exercise model fields expanded, WorkoutSession & MaxSnapshot models added | P1 |
| `specs/05-exercise-library.md` | Categories updated to free-exercise-db taxonomy, seed count 873 | P1 |

These have been validated across multiple iterations but remain uncommitted (showing in `git status` as modified).

**Specs updated this pass:** 0  
**Continue building?** Yes — no blockers. Consider committing the two spec diffs at next stopping point.
