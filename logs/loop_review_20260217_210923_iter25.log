## Quick Spec Review — Iteration 25

**Findings: 0 new**

Build log (iter 25, Task 4.1) completed cleanly:
- Coach CRUD API routes created (`/api/coaches` and `/api/coaches/[id]`)
- TypeScript clean, build successful
- Committed as `877981f`
- No inconsistencies, mismatches, or unexpected values

| Item | Count |
|------|-------|
| New findings | 0 |
| Specs updated | 0 |
| Prior uncommitted spec changes | 2 files — already correct, from Tasks 2.1/2.3 |

The two uncommitted spec files (`01-data-models-and-schema.md`, `05-exercise-library.md`) contain valid corrections discovered during earlier iterations (exercise model fields, category taxonomy, WorkoutSession/MaxSnapshot models, seed count). These are accurate and should be committed when convenient.

**Continue building?** Yes — Task 4.1 done cleanly. Ready for next task.
