**Task 31.2 complete.** Here's what was built:

**New component: `WorkoutSessionDetail`** (`src/components/athletes/WorkoutSessionDetail.tsx`)
- Two-column **Prescribed vs Actual** layout per exercise with clear column headers
- **Green/amber/red** status badges and left-border indicators per exercise (Met/Partial/Missed)
- Set-by-set breakdown table with color-coded reps and RPE adherence
- Per-exercise volume diff with trend arrows (+/-%)
- Session summary cards (exercises, completion %, volume, duration)
- Status distribution counts (X met, Y partial, Z missed)
- Total volume comparison with progress bar and percentage

**API enhancement** (`/api/athletes/[id]/history`):
- Added `rir`, `notes` to SetLog response
- Added `supersetGroup`, `supersetColor`, `notes`, `athleteNotes` from WorkoutExercise

**Refactored `WorkoutHistoryList`** to use the new `WorkoutSessionDetail` component in its expanded view, replacing the previous inline detail rendering.

All validation passes: `tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`.
