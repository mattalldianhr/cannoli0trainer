**Task 17.8 complete.** Here's what was built:

**Files created:**
- `src/app/schedule/page.tsx` — Server component that fetches athletes and their WorkoutSessions for the displayed week using Prisma. Supports `?week=YYYY-MM-DD` search param for week navigation.
- `src/components/schedule/WeeklyCalendar.tsx` — Client component with:
  - 7-day week grid (Mon-Sun columns, athlete rows)
  - Today column highlighting
  - Session cells showing workout title, W/D numbers, completion %, and status icons (not started, in progress, completed, skipped)
  - Athlete dropdown filter
  - Previous/next week navigation via URL search params
  - "Today" button to return to current week
  - Status legend
  - Sticky athlete name column for horizontal scroll
  - Links from athlete names to their profile pages

**Files modified:**
- `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` — Added "Schedule" nav link between Programs and Exercises
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — Marked Task 17.8 complete (84/179)

**Validation:** `tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` both pass.
