**Task 23.1 complete.** 

Created `ProgramOverview` component at `src/components/programs/ProgramOverview.tsx` and integrated it into the program detail page (`/programs/[id]`):

- **Table layout**: Weeks as rows (W1, W2...), days as columns (Day 1, Day 2...)
- **Cell content**: Workout name, exercise count badge, top 3 exercise names with "+N more" overflow
- **Navigation**: Each cell is an anchor link to `#week-N`, scrolling to the corresponding week card below
- **Responsive**: Horizontal scroll on narrow screens via `overflow-x-auto`
- **Empty handling**: Dash for missing days when weeks have uneven day counts

All validation passed (tsc, build). Committed as `78c8697`.
