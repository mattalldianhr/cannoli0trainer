**Task 17.4 complete.** 

Here's what was done:

- Updated `/api/programs/[id]/assign` to integrate the scheduling pipeline
- After creating ProgramAssignments, the API now fetches the program's workouts and calls `generateSchedule()` + `persistSchedule()` for each athlete when `startDate` is provided
- Added support for optional `trainingDays` parameter (validated as array of 0-6 integers, defaults to `[1,2,4,5]`)
- Added support for single-athlete assignment via `athleteId` param (in addition to existing `athleteIds` array)
- `trainingDays` and `isActive` are now persisted on ProgramAssignment records
- Response includes `scheduling.sessionsCreated` count and per-athlete details
- All 186 tests pass, `tsc --noEmit` clean, build succeeds
