**Task 27.1 complete.** Here's what was implemented:

**API** (`src/app/api/analytics/[athleteId]/route.ts`):
- Added `getRPEHistory()` — queries SetLog for all sets with RPE, returns individual data points (date, rpe, weight, reps, exercise name) and a simple moving average trend line for RPE drift detection
- Respects existing `rpeExerciseId` filter and date range params
- Capped at 3,000 sets to prevent oversized responses

**Chart** (`src/components/charts/RPEHistoryChart.tsx`):
- ComposedChart with Scatter (individual sets, violet dots at 50% opacity) + Line (moving average trend)
- Custom tooltip showing RPE, exercise name, weight/reps, and date
- Y-axis fixed to 6-10.5 RPE range with 0.5 increments
- Legend showing dot = individual sets, line = moving average, with total count

**Dashboard** (`src/components/analytics/AnalyticsDashboard.tsx`):
- Chart renders in the RPE section after Weekly Avg RPE
- Only shows when `rpeHistory.hasData` is true
- Filterable by exercise via the existing dropdown

All validation passed: `tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`.
