## Quick Spec Review Summary

**Findings: 0 issues**

The last 5 build logs (iter 1-5 from the current session) all report clean completions:
- Task 21.3: Offline queue design doc
- Task 21.4: Offline queue implementation
- Task 22.1: Quick action FAB for mobile
- Task 22.2: Skeleton loading states
- Task 23.1: Program overview compact grid

No logs contain "issues encountered", "inconsistency", "doesn't match", "actually", or "missing" in a spec-conflict context. All tasks passed `tsc` and `build` validation. The review logs for this session are empty (the loop appears to have stopped generating review content).

**Specs updated:** None needed
**Continue building?** Yes — no blockers or spec inconsistencies found.
