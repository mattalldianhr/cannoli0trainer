**Task 18.1 complete.** Here's what was done:

- Installed `next-auth@5.0.0-beta.30`, `@auth/prisma-adapter@2.11.1`, and `resend@6.9.2`
- Created `src/lib/auth.ts` with NextAuth config using Resend email provider (magic link), JWT session strategy, and callbacks that:
  - Gate sign-in to only pre-registered athletes (by email match)
  - Attach `athleteId` to JWT token
  - Expose `athleteId` on the session object
  - Route to custom `/athlete/login` and `/athlete/check-email` pages
- Created `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` exporting the GET/POST handlers
- Created `.env.example` documenting `DATABASE_URL`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `AUTH_URL`, `AUTH_RESEND_KEY`, and `EMAIL_FROM`
- Added `AUTH_SECRET` placeholder to `.env` for dev builds
- All validations pass: `tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`
