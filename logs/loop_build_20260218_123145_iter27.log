**Task 18.11 complete.** Here's what was done:

**Created** `src/lib/notifications.ts`:
- `notifyProgramAssignment()` — sends branded HTML email via Resend with program name, start date, and link to `/athlete/train`
- `notifyWorkoutCompletion()` — sends email to coach with athlete name, workout name, completion %, and link to athlete profile (pre-built for Task 18.12)
- Lazy Resend client initialization to avoid build errors when `AUTH_RESEND_KEY` is not set
- Fire-and-forget pattern — errors logged but never thrown to callers

**Modified** `src/app/api/programs/[id]/assign/route.ts`:
- Added import and fire-and-forget call to `notifyProgramAssignment()` after successful assignment
- Updated athlete query to include `email` and `name` for notification

**Validation**: `tsc --noEmit` passes, `npm run build` passes.
