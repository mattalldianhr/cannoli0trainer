**Task 17.7 complete.** Here's what was done:

**API** (`src/app/api/train/route.ts`):
- When no `WorkoutSession` exists for the requested athlete+date, the API now queries for the next upcoming `NOT_STARTED` (non-skipped) session
- Returns `nextSession: { date, title, programName }` in the response (or `null` if no future sessions exist)

**UI** (`src/components/training/TrainingLog.tsx`):
- Added `NextSessionData` interface to the `TrainResponse` type
- Changed the empty state heading to "Rest Day" when viewing today's date
- Added a clickable "Next: {day} — {title}" link that jumps the date picker to the next scheduled workout

**Validation**: `tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` both pass. Committed as `db688fa`.
