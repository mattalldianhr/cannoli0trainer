**Task 4.2 complete.** Created CRUD API routes for Athletes:

- **`/api/athletes` (route.ts)**: POST creates an athlete (validates name + coachId, checks coach exists), GET lists athletes with optional `search`, `coachId`, `isCompetitor`, and `isRemote` query params. Includes counts of setLogs, workoutSessions, and programAssignments.

- **`/api/athletes/[id]` (route.ts)**: GET returns full athlete profile with coach info, program assignments, recent 10 workout sessions, and relation counts. PUT updates any subset of fields. DELETE removes athlete with 404 check.

All validation passed (tsc, build). Committed as `4148e8b`.
