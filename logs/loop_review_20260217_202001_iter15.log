Good — `prescribedLoad` is `String?` in Prisma which matches the spec. The type coercion note is about TeamBuildr sending numbers where the schema expects strings — that's a transformer implementation detail, not a spec issue.

Now let me assess the findings:

**Finding 1: Total exercise count is 948, not 873**
- Spec 05 says "873 exercises from free-exercise-db" — that's the seed count
- The 948 total = 873 seeded + 75 new exercises added from TeamBuildr data (9 explicitly mentioned + others from the mapping process)
- The spec correctly says "873 exercises from free-exercise-db" — that's accurate for the seed. The additional exercises came from TeamBuildr import. This is **not a spec error** — the 948 is the post-import total, not the seed count.

**Finding 2: Type coercion (prescribedLoad number→string, set fields string→number)**
- This is a TeamBuildr data quality quirk handled by the transformer. The Prisma schema types are correct. **P3 — implementation detail, no spec change needed.**

**Finding 3: 9 missing exercises + 2 case-sensitivity mappings**
- These are TeamBuildr↔exercise-library mapping gaps fixed in code. The exercise library spec doesn't need to enumerate every exercise. **P3 — no spec change needed.**

## Quick Spec Review — Iteration 15

**Findings: 0 spec issues**

The iter15 build (Task 2.5 — workout history import) completed cleanly. Key observations:

| Item | Assessment | Priority |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Total exercises now 948 (was 873 seeded) | Expected — 75 new from TeamBuildr import | Not a spec issue |
| Type coercion in transformer (number↔string) | TeamBuildr data quirk, Prisma types correct | P3 — implementation detail |
| 9 missing exercises + 2 case mappings | Mapping gaps fixed in code | P3 — implementation detail |

**Specs updated:** 0 (both spec 01 and 05 were already corrected in iter13)
**Continue building?** Yes — no blockers.
