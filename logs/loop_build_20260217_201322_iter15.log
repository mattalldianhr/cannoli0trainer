**Task 2.5 complete.** Here's the summary:

**What was built:**
- `seedWorkoutHistory()` function in `prisma/seed.ts` that transforms and imports the full TeamBuildr export into the database
- Creates per-athlete "TeamBuildr Import" Programs as containers for Workout/WorkoutExercise records
- Processes 2,033 session dates with all exercises, sets, and max snapshots
- Idempotent — skips if data already exists

**Fixes applied:**
- Added 9 missing exercises to `teambuildrNewExercises` (Bulgarian Split Squat, Glute Bridge, Kettlebell Swing, etc.)
- Added 2 case-sensitivity mappings to `teambuildrToFreeExerciseDb` (Band Assisted Pull-up, Bicep Exercise of choice)
- Runtime type coercion for `prescribedLoad` (number→string) and set fields (string→number) since TeamBuildr JSON types are looser than TS definitions

**Final verified counts:**
| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| WorkoutSessions | 2,033 |
| WorkoutExercises | 12,283 |
| SetLogs | 31,660 |
| MaxSnapshots | 5,316 |
| Total exercises | 948 |
