## Quick Spec Review — Iteration 14

**Findings: 0 new issues**

The iter13 review already caught and fixed the 2 P1 issues:
1. WorkoutExercise missing 5 fields (supersetGroup, supersetColor, isUnilateral, restTimeSeconds, tempo) — **fixed in spec 01**
2. WorkoutSession + MaxSnapshot models missing from spec — **fixed in spec 01**

The iter14 build (Task 2.4 — coach/athlete seeding) completed cleanly with no spec inconsistencies. The 5 athletes and coach data match the TeamBuildr export.

**Specs updated this cycle:** 2 (`01-data-models-and-schema.md`, `05-exercise-library.md`) — both already updated in iter13
**Specs needing update now:** 0
**Continue building?** Yes — no blockers.
