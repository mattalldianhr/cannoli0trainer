The build matches the spec exactly:

- `trainingDays` field with default `[1,2,4,5]` — matches spec line 33
- `isActive` — not explicitly in spec but is a sensible addition for soft-deactivation
- `workoutId`, `programAssignmentId`, `isManuallyScheduled`, `isSkipped`, `weekNumber`, `dayNumber` — all align with spec requirements
