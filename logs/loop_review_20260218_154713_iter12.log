## Quick Spec Review Summary

- **Findings: 0**
- **Specs updated: None**
- **Continue building? Yes**

All recent logs (iterations 10-12, tasks 24.3 through 25.2) are clean:
- No issues, inconsistencies, or mismatches found
- All tasks passed `tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build`
- 221/221 tests passing
- Only known issue is a pre-existing `next lint` problem (already documented)
- Iter12 review log is empty (0 bytes) — review hadn't been written when files were saved

The loop is healthy. No spec updates needed.
