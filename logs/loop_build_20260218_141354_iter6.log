**Task 21.1 complete.** Here's what was built:

**New file:** `src/components/training/RestTimer.tsx`
- Countdown timer with `formatTime` display (M:SS format)
- Start/pause, reset, and dismiss controls
- Progress bar that fills as time elapses
- Audio alert (880Hz beep via Web Audio API) and vibration on expiration
- Visual state change (green border/bg) when timer completes

**Modified:** `src/components/training/TrainingLog.tsx`
- Timer triggers automatically after logging a set via `handleLogSet`
- Does NOT trigger when the final prescribed set completes (exercise done)
- Duration defaults to `WorkoutExercise.restTimeSeconds` or 120s fallback
- Timer renders inline between logged sets and the new set form
- Non-blocking — athlete can dismiss and continue logging at any time

All validation passed: `tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`.
