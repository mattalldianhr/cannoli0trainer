## Quick Spec Review — Iteration 18

**Findings: 0 new spec issues**

The iter18 build (Task 2.8 — RPE/RIR lookup table) completed cleanly:
- `src/lib/rpe-table.ts` implemented with 108-point Tuchscherer table
- All 4 helper functions + constants working
- `tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` both pass

The 2 modified spec files (`01-data-models-and-schema.md`, `05-exercise-library.md`) contain previously-discovered updates from Tasks 2.1 and 2.3 — already written, just not yet committed.

**Continue building?** Yes — Phase 2 (Tasks 2.1–2.8) appears fully complete. Ready for Phase 3.
