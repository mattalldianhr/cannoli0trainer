Task 11.2 complete. Here's what was implemented:

**Task 11.2: Add recent activity feed to dashboard**

- Added `getRecentActivity()` function that queries WorkoutSessions from the last 7 days with athlete info, grouped by date
- Parallelized the stats and activity feed queries with `Promise.all` for performance
- Activity feed displays sessions grouped by day with smart date labels (Today, Yesterday, or weekday/date)
- Each session row shows: athlete avatar initial, name, session title, exercise completion count, and completion percentage badge
- Session rows link to the athlete profile page
- Empty state shown when no sessions exist in the last 7 days
- Uses existing UI components (Card, Badge, Link) and lucide icons (Activity, Calendar)
- All validation passes: `tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`
