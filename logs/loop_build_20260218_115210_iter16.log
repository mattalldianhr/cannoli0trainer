**Task 17.14 complete.** 

Integration test at `src/lib/scheduling/__tests__/assignment-to-train.integration.test.ts` covers the full assignment-to-train flow with 7 test cases:

1. Creates a 2-week, 3-day program with exercises
2. Assigns it to an athlete and verifies 6 WorkoutSessions on correct dates (Mon/Tue/Thu schedule)
3. Idempotency — re-running schedule creates no duplicates
4. `/api/train` returns correct workout and exercises for a scheduled date
5. Rest day returns no session but provides `nextSession` info
6. All 6 scheduled dates return correct workout with full exercises
7. Non-training days have no sessions from the assignment

All validation passes: `tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, 7/7 tests passing.
