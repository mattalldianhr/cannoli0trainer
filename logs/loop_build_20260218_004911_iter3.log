**Task 11.3 complete.** 

Added a "Needs Attention" section to the dashboard that:
- Queries athletes with no workout sessions in the last 3 days
- Displays each flagged athlete with their name, email, and days since last session
- Links each row to the athlete's profile page
- Shows an empty state message when all athletes are active
- Updated the stat card icon to `AlertTriangle` and linked it to scroll to the section via `#needs-attention` anchor
- Runs in parallel with the other dashboard queries for performance
