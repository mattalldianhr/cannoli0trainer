# TeamBuildr: Comprehensive Business Analysis

## Executive Summary

TeamBuildr is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform founded in 2011-2012 by Hewitt Tomlin and James Peters that serves as "the original strength & conditioning platform" for coaches, gym owners, and athletic organizations. Operating from Maryland with an additional office in Dublin, Ireland, the company serves 3,000+ teams ranging from high schools to professional sports organizations including the Denver Nuggets, Tennessee Titans, and Washington Spirit. The platform operates on a tiered subscription model ($600-$2,400 annually as of 2023) and combines four integrated products: Strength (program design and mobile delivery), Athletic Monitoring System/AMS (performance and recovery tracking), Operating System/OS (gym management), and Practice (team training planning). The company maintains a 4.2-star rating on Trustpilot (479 reviews) with 75% five-star ratings, emphasizing same-day customer support and claims of 95%+ customer satisfaction.

## Company Overview & History

### Founding and Origins
TeamBuildr was founded by Hewitt Tomlin and James Peters, who created the platform while playing football at Johns Hopkins University. According to multiple sources, the company officially began selling software in 2012, though foundational work occurred in 2011. The founders addressed a specific pain point: athletes consistently lost or forgot printed workout prescriptions, and strength and conditioning lacked an effective, affordable digital solution at scale. As Hewitt Tomlin noted in an interview, the fundamental flaw they identified was that "while coaches had used several methods of prescribing and tracking programs over two decades, few had been effective and affordable enough to materially impact programs in schools and at the professional level."
