## Key Concepts & Definitions

### Core Platform Architecture

**TeamBuildr Strength**: The original and flagship product offering programming, athlete tracking, exercise libraries, and performance reporting. Available across four pricing tiers (Silver, Gold, Platinum, Platinum Pro) based on athlete capacity.

**Athletic Management System (AMS)**: Add-on module providing enhanced recovery and wellness tracking, injury monitoring, and readiness assessment capabilities that expand Strength platform reporting.

**Weight Room View (WRV)**: Tablet-based interface allowing 4-8 athletes to simultaneously access individualized workouts and log performance data in real-time without smartphone dependency.

**TV Mode**: Display interface for weight room or facility walls showing individualized workouts and real-time performance data to multiple athletes on shared screens.

**Autoregulatory Progressive Resistance Exercise (APRE)**: Training methodology where athletes progress based on daily performance rather than predetermined percentage-based schemes. TeamBuildr is notably "the only online software to build out the Autoregulatory Progressive Resistance Exercise protocol."

**Velocity-Based Training (VBT)**: Integration of movement speed tracking during exercises to assess fatigue, enable autoregulation, and provide real-time feedback on training readiness.

## Main Features & Capabilities

### 1. Program Design & Programming

**Flexibility & Control**: The platform explicitly "doesn't tell you how to program, we give you full control" whether managing one athlete or hundreds. Coaches can "build individualized programming in minutes, not hours."

**Multi-Tiered Calendar System**: Programs utilize a calendar-based structure supporting custom periodization methods. Coaches can implement sport-specific programming, in-season/off-season phases, and specialty periodization models (Conjugate, Triphasic, linear, non-linear).

**Pre-Built Templates**: TeamBuildr provides up to 100 research-based strength and conditioning templates that are "able to be edited and modified by the coach" to match specific coaching philosophies and team needs. Templates include sport-specific variations and testing protocols.

**Free Form Programming**: Athletes can engage with workouts at their own pace, accommodating varying schedules—particularly valuable for remote training, group training with staggered schedules, or individualized progression models.

**APRE Automation**: TeamBuildr automates APRE programming by automatically calculating next session weights based on athlete performance in previous sets. The system eliminates manual percentage calculations, saving coaches approximately 2-3 minutes per station. The process works as follows:
- Athletes perform prescribed warm-up and set 1-2 at baseline loads
- Sets 3-5 allow athletes to enter rep adjustments (up/down) based on performance
- The system automatically recalculates 1RM and adjusts the next workout's loads accordingly
- Athletes see adjustments on their screens without manual chart lookups

This represents significant automation over traditional periodized approaches where loads are predetermined for entire microcycles.

### 2. Exercise Library & Database

**Comprehensive Library Scale**: The Platinum tier includes up to 700 exercises with video tutorials. Lower tiers access a substantial portion of this library.

**Video Content Integration**: Every exercise includes demonstration videos showing proper technique and form. Videos are professionally produced and accessible directly within athlete workout screens.

**Full Customization**: Coaches can "add to, delete or edit our entire exercise database to fit their preferences," ensuring the library matches program philosophy and facility equipment. This customization extends to exercise naming, variations, and form cues.

**Video Upload Capability**: Athletes can record themselves performing exercises directly from mobile devices, allowing coaches to evaluate form remotely and provide feedback without in-person observation.

**Coach Testimonials**: Yale University's Director of Performance Tom Newman described the template library as "contemporary and quality" and valued it "as a great source of perspective" for his coaching staff.

### 3. Testing & Assessment Capabilities

**1RM Tracking & Formula**: TeamBuildr includes advanced 1RM tracking functionality across all pricing tiers. A proprietary "TeamBuildr 1RM Formula" automatically estimates 1RM based on working set performance. This formula updates continuously as athletes enter data:
- Athletes see current 1RM, goal 1RM, and progress tracking on mobile
- The formula recalculates with each set entered
- This prevents athletes from waiting until formal test days to see progress
- Compatible with APRE programming for autoregulated load progression

**Custom Goals & Standards**: Coaches can establish individual or group goals for:
- Lifts (specific exercises with 1RM targets)
- Runs/endurance activities
- Speed/agility metrics
- Circuits and bodyweight assessments
- Sport-specific performance benchmarks

**Fitness Assessment Software**: The platform includes functionality for setting fitness standards and benchmarks that can be compared to group averages, identifying strength imbalances and areas requiring emphasis.

## Specific Implementation Examples

### APRE Workflow Example

A coach assigns an APRE program with:
1. **Warm-up**: 50% of estimated 1RM (8 reps), 60% (5 reps), 70% (2 reps)
2. **Set 1-2**: 75% of estimated 1RM (prescribed reps, e.g., 5 reps)
3. **Sets 3-5**: Athlete performs at 80% estimated 1RM, then adjusts up or down based on performance

If athlete completes 8 reps on set 3:
- System calculates new estimated 1RM using TeamBuildr formula
- Next workout automatically displays adjusted loads based on new 1RM
- Athlete sees customized weights without manual chart lookup
- This saves coaches approximately 2-3 minutes per athlete per session

### Weight Room View Implementation

At a collegiate strength and conditioning program:
- 4-8 athletes assigned to a squat station with iPad mounted at rack
- Each athlete's personalized workout displays with their prescribed loads
- Athlete performs sets, then enters reps completed on tablet
- Coach views real-time performance on tablet, makes immediate cuing adjustments
- After workout, data automatically populates into athlete profile
- No manual documentation, no lost data, no smartphone clutter

### VBT Integration with Perch

A professional sports team uses Perch cameras above squat racks:
- Athletes perform squat sets while Perch tracks bar velocity
- Data automatically migrates every 2 minutes to TeamBuildr
- Coach views velocity trends on-screen
- If velocity drops below 0.35 m/s threshold (fatigue indicator), athlete receives cue to reduce load or terminate set
- End-of-week reports show velocity trends indicating readiness patterns
- Coaches adjust next week's programming based on velocity data trends

### Remote Coaching Scenario

A personal trainer works with geographically dispersed clients:
- Client films squat with mobile phone, uploads to TeamBuildr
- Coach receives notification, reviews video with feedback comment
- Client reads feedback, adjusts form, submits revised video next session
- Progression based on coach cue incorporation rather than calendar week
- All video history maintained in platform, enabling form pattern analysis over time
