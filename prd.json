The trainer operates as a solo coach out of i work out of multiple locations. Coaching roles include: Powerlifting Coach, 1-on-1 Personal Trainer, Remote / Online Coach, Group / Class Coach, Meet Director / Event Organizer. The interview identified key workflow pain points, methodology requirements (including VBT and RPE-based programming), competition prep needs, desired platform capabilities, and business growth goals."
