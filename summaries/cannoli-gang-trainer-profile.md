## Key Business Gaps Identified

### Critical
1. **No visible programming delivery platform** - No mention of any coaching software for writing, delivering, or tracking remote programming. This is the most significant operational gap for someone offering remote coaching.
2. **No client onboarding system** - Process appears to be Calendly booking → manual coordination. No intake forms, client portal, or structured workflow.
3. **Solo operator scaling limits** - Growth capped by Joe's available hours. No systems for group programming products, template marketplace, or scalable offerings.

### Important
4. **Brand fragmentation** - Unclear relationship between "Cannoli Strength," "Cannoli Gang," "S&S Barbell," and "Squats and Science"
5. **Small social footprint** - ~1,300 Instagram followers, no TikTok/YouTube/Facebook. Significant credibility-to-visibility gap given national-level results.
6. **No public pricing** - Consultation-first model creates friction for self-qualifying leads
7. **Gmail as business email** - Unprofessional for the brand level
8. **Sparse content** - Only 3 blog posts visible. Inconsistent cadence limits SEO and audience building.
9. **No testimonials/social proof** - Only one brief client testimonial found on site
