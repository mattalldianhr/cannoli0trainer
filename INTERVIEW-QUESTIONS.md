## What Changed from the Generic Interview

The original interview was designed for any S&C coach (high school, college, pro team, military, etc.). This version is redesigned around the specific profile of an independent powerlifting coach:

1. **Removed institutional questions** — No SSO, FERPA/HIPAA/NCAA compliance, ARMS integration, Student Information Systems, Hudl, Catapult GPS. These are irrelevant for an independent coach at a Brooklyn gym.

2. **Added powerlifting-specific sections** — Competition prep (attempt selection, peaking, warmup timing, weight class management), federation-specific context (USAPL).

3. **Deepened VBT coverage** — Not just "do you use VBT?" but "what would you want a platform to do with your velocity data?" since Joe is a known VBT practitioner.

4. **Added business/growth section** — Revenue models, growth goals, template sales, brand building. An independent coach's platform needs are inseparable from their business model.

5. **Reframed pain points** — Instead of generic "biggest frustrations," asks about specific time sinks, data gaps, and tools that were tried and abandoned.

6. **Made it conversational** — Questions use second person ("your athletes," "your practice") and natural language instead of formal survey-speak.

7. **Reduced from 11 sections to 9** — Merged Communication into Day-in-Life, merged Technical Requirements into Dream Platform, removed the separate Budget section (integrated into Business & Growth).
